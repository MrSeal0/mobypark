# Documentation

- Your bruno test files can be pushed to git, it is completely fine!


## Tool

**Note: You need to install npm to be able to do this, enough documentation can be found about that on the internet!**

In the tool directory you will find a tool called 'document_api.js'.
Running that file by using
```bash
node document_api.js
```

will create an excel spreadsheat from the requests in bruno.
